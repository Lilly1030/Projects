# Projects
This repository is a collection of all the projects I did and contributed in.

# Project-1: Image Super Resolution
  Open jupyter notebook

  Install all necessary libraries:

  pip install sys keras cv2-python numpy matplotlib skimage h5py

  Check and change the dataset path if necessary

  Run all functions
  
# Project-2: Linear Regression with Numpy and Python
  1.Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch.
  
  2.Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python.
  
  3.Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib.
  
  To run the code in Google Colab:
  
  Step-1:Download the .ipynb file and .txt file for dataset.
  
  Step-2:Start by installing the required libraries by running " pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn ".
  
  Step-3:Upload the dataset to Mydrive and change the path in the code accordingly.
  
  Step-4:Run all the cells.
  
# Project-3: Visualizing CNN Filters using TensorFlow
  1.Use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model.
  
  2.Will visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN.
  
  3.Use gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.
  
  To run the code in colab:
  
  Step-1:Download the ipynb code file and open it in google colab.
  
  Step-2:Switch to GPU mode for faster Computation (Runtime--> Change runtime--> GPU).
  
  Step-3:Run all the cells.
  
  Step-4:Visualize differnt blocks of convolution filter patterns.
  
# Project-4: Tesla (TSLA) Stock Price prediction using Facebook Prophet 
  1.Build a Facebook Prophet Machine learning model in order to forecast the price of Tesla 30 days into the future.
  
  2.Evaluate the performance of the model against real data using Google Finance in Google Sheets.
  
  3.Analyzing, visualizing and forecasting the price of any stock.
  
  To run the code in colab:
  
  Step-1:Download the .ipynb file and TSLA.csv file for dataset.
  
  Step-2:Switch to GPU mode for faster Computation (Runtime--> Change runtime--> GPU).
  
  Step-3:Upload the dataset to local colab runtime or change the path to the file location accordingly.
  
  Step-4:Run all the cells.

# Project-5: Creating Multi Task Models With Keras
  1.create and train multi-task, multi-output models with Keras. 
  
  2.Use Keras' functional API to create a multi output model which will be trained to learn two different labels given the same input example.
  
  3.Use a ResNet style skip connection in the model.
  
  4.Based the generated image the model predicts the number and the color of the image
  
  To run the code in colab:
  
  Step-1:Download the ipynb code file and open it in google colab.
  
  Step-2:Switch to GPU mode for faster Computation (Runtime--> Change runtime--> GPU).
  
  Step-3:Allow cookies so that you can see the tensorflow board which gives the accuracy, loss function etc..
  
  Step-4:Run all the cells.
